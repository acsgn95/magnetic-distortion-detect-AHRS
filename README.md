# magnetic-distortion-detect-AHRS

AHRSs determine the orientation of a system. 
It takes place in INS systems as discrete or integrated. 
The sensitivity of the INS system is highly dependent on the sensitivity of the AHRS system. 
The study here is for an academic article study. 
And the study tests the threshold magnetic distortion detection algorithm used in AHRS systems.
AHRS algorithm is an EKF based algorithm.
It has 7 system states.
